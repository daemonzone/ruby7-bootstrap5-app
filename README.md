# Ruby on Rails 7, Bootstrap 5

## What's this?

A ready to start rails7 + bootstrap5 project. Bootstrap is imported via Gemfile and it uses importmap-rails for the javascript part. Feel free to fork this project and change it to suit your needs

## What's next

I'm planning to add some basic authentication views and standard mailers, as I did on other project templates in the past

Stay tuned!

Inspired by [Rails 7, Bootstrap 5 tutorial : fear and relief](https://bootrails.com/blog/rails-7-bootstrap-5-tutorial) (David B / 20 December 2021)

> Rails 7 has a very opinionated way to handle the front-end assets. Let’s see how it works for Bootstrap 5.\

> At BootrAils, we are very excited that Rails 7 is out since mid-december, 2021. The frontend assets management is once again completely different. Rails 6 almost dropped Sprockets in favor of Webpack – see this article, now Rails 7 almost dropped Webpack in favor of jsbundling-rails (with esbuild) + import maps + Sprockets.\

> So we, as Rails developers, have choices. For this tutorial, we will use the default Rails 7 options – but we are not sure you should. That’s the fear. Relief will be for the end of the article.\
